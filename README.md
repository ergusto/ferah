# Ferah 

Ferah is a web application I made for an ex-partner and I to communicate through. Functionality is intentionally very simple; users can create named and tagged conversations and post messages in those conversations. Technology stack: Django, Postgres, Amazon S3. Originally built in 2014.

Feel free to log in and play around with the username `test` and password `test`.
