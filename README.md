# Ferah 

Ferah is a web application I made for my girlfriend and I to communicate through. Functionality is intentionally very simple; users can create named conversations and post messages in those conversations. It's also possible to tag conversations to categorise them. That's pretty much it, but it does look pretty, and Ajax is damn sexy. Hosted on Heroku - for free, no less.
